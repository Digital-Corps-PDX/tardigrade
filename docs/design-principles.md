# Design Principles

Tardigrade AI was built to make invisible systems visible.  
Every pattern in this library exists to make automation legible to the people it affects.

## 1. Make automation explicit
People should always know when a decision, summary, or action was made or assisted by AI.  
If automation is part of a process, it should be disclosed where it happens, not buried in documentation.

## 2. Keep explanations short and human-readable
A disclosure is successful when a person can understand it in one glance.  
Avoid abstraction, jargon, or machine learning language that obscures responsibility.

## 3. Preserve human control
Automation should never remove the right to review, contest, or appeal a decision.  
Every pattern must make human oversight and intervention visible and actionable.

## 4. Show boundaries
Draw clear lines between what the system decides, what it recommends, and what humans decide.  
Ambiguity erodes accountability.

## 5. Favor process transparency over technical detail
People care more about how an automated decision affects them than about how a model works.  
Patterns should focus on workflow, not math.

## 6. Design for durability
Tardigrade AI patterns should survive regulation changes, redesigns, and platform updates.  
Plain language, semantic HTML, and minimal dependencies ensure long-term accessibility.

## 7. Default to visibility
When in doubt, show it.  
Disclosures should err on the side of revealing too much rather than too little.  
Opacity protects no one.

Tardigrade AI treats disclosure as infrastructure.  
If automation becomes standard, visibility must too.
